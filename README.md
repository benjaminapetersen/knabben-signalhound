# SignalHunter

Hunts Flake And Failing Testgrid Jobs

SignalHunter monitors TestGrid dashboards to identify and summarize test failures and flaking patterns in Kubernetes
CI/CD pipelines. It provides actionable insights for CI signal enumeration, currently focusing on
`sig-release-master-blocking` and `sig-release-master-informing` dashboards.

## Features

### ðŸ“Š Test Monitoring Dashboard

Run SignalHunter with the `abstract` command to launch an interactive text user interface (TUI) that displays:

* Board#Tabs combinations in the first panel for easy navigation
* Test listings when selecting specific board combinations
*  Dual information panels:
** Left panel: Slack summary from #release-ci-signal channel (Markdown formatted)
** Right panel: GitHub issue template with Kubernetes defaults (Markdown formatted)

### ðŸ“‹ Draft issues automatically in the CI Signal Board
Access drafts in the DRAFTING section after selecting a panel and pressing Ctrl-B
Configure with a Personal Access Token (PAT) with appropriate repository permissions

* Clipboard Integration
 
Press Ctrl-Space on any panel to copy content to clipboard
Currently optimized for WSL2 environments

## Installation and Build

Prerequisites

* Go 1.24 or later
* Git
* Github Token PAT
* Kubernetes cluster (kind)

### Running at runtime

```bash
git clone https://github.com/knabben/signalhunter.git
cd signalhunter
make run  # for abstract and standalone
make run-controller # for running the controller outside the cluster
```

### To Deploy on the cluster

**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/signalhound:tag
```

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/signalhound:tag
```

**Create instances of your solution**

You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

### To Uninstall

**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```
